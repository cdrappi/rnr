# rnr
A template for React Native + Rust apps

<!-- This gives you [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) auth and a few extra files to help you deploy with GCP. I've left a few `TODO`s in the code, so you can set up your own app. You can see what the template looks like [here](https://rnr.herokuapp.com), but I'm not sure why you would want to, because it only lets you log in -->
